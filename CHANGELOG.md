# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.16.0 - 2019-07-14

This feature release updates the base from `renovate@14.23.0` to `renovate@18.16.11`.

### Build changes

The `renovate/pro` image now uses `renovate/renovate` as its base image, meaning that you can determine exactly which binary files come preinstalled by looking at the [corresponding Renovate OSS Dockerfile](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/2f2c0736f67414a2d2fc0b129ca95dfc41bf0289/Dockerfile).

A second important change is that Renovate Pro now uses `git` under the hood for all file system queries. Renovate Pro performs a shallow clone each run like a CI system typically does, and having the full repo locally also enables some advanced features such as Go Modules vendoring.

### New Package Managers

- **Maven**: Supported added for `pom.xml` parsing, including ranges
- **Pipenv**: Pipfile and lock file updating now enabled
- **Poetry**: An alternative Python package manager
- **Ruby-version**: Update `.ruby-version` files
- **Dart**: Add support for package manager
- **Scala**: sbt support

## 0.15.5

This patch fixes one issue: URLs in complex `--index-url` lines in Pip `requirements.txt` files are now parsed correctly.

## 0.15.4

This release was removed.

## 0.15.3 - 2019-03-07

This patch fixes two issues:

- Fixes global proxy support via `HTTPS_PROXY` etc (#42)
- Fixes GitLab scheduler authentication regression introduced in 0.15.2

## 0.15.2 - 2019-02-23

This patch release adds a slight refactoring to the way token handling is configured for GitHub Enterprise in an effort to fix or track down a missing token problem experienced by one user when upgrading to 0.15.x.

## 0.15.1 - 2019-02-20

This patch releases fixes a problem for GitLab where `GITLAB_TOKEN` was still required for pre-flight checks. Now, only `RENOVATE_TOKEN` is necessary for GitLab.

## 0.15.0 - 2019-02-18

This feature release updates the base `renovate` to `v14.19.1` and includes many new features.

### Breaking Changes

Please update your environment variables to use `RENOVATE_PLATFORM`, `RENOVATE_ENDPOINT` and `RENOVATE_TOKEN` instead of the deprecated `GITHUB_` and `GITLAB_` equivalents.

Also, as the underlying image for Renovate Pro has changed, make sure to switch the Docker user from `node` to `ubuntu` if you have configured that manually, e.g. in your Docker Compose file.

### New features

Ansible: support renovating Docker images
Bazel: Go support
CircleCI: Orb support
Docker: add support for basic auth (e.g. Artifactory)
Docker: preserve registry in `depName`
GitHub: block automerging a PR if negative reviews exist
Gradle: support updating gradle wrapper version
Onboarding: warn about unresolved packages
Other: Add ability to suppress Renovate notifications configurably
Other: Add proxy supportPackage Rules: support filtering by manager, language or sourceUrl
PRs: add rebasing checkbox
Pypi: try multiple hostUrls
Pypi: add simple URL endpoint support
Yarn: support integrity hashes

### Bug fixes

Artifactory: skip npm cache permanently
Docker: fix registryUrls support for `https://` prefix
Docker: fix header for tag fetching (Artifactory compatibility)
Docker: skip lookups for images containing variables
GitHub Enterprise: Fix release notes fetching from GHE
npm: Fix `.npmrc` package-lock massage
PRs: Fix rebase checkbox when conflicted

### Other

Renovate Pro now runs on Ubuntu 18.04 as its base image. This is to align with the open source Renovate's container base as well as Renovate's companion docker containers, all of which use Ubuntu 18.04. If you are mapping any files to `/home/node` then you need to now map them to `/home/ubuntu` instead.

## 0.14.0 - 2018-11-06

This feature release adds several new package managers plus many feature improvements. It upgrades the base `renovate` to v13.121.0.

### New Package Managers

#### Go Modules

Renovate now supports updating `go.mod` and `go.sum` files - both for dependencies using semver versions as well as those still using git digests. The `go` binary is bundled with Renovate Pro and runs inside the main container.

#### Composer (PHP)

Composer support is now officially released and supports `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files. The `composer` binary is also bundled with the main Renovate Pro container.

#### Terraform Modules

Renovate Pro now supports updating Terraform Modules - both for dependencies hosted on github as well as using Terraform's official registry. No binary is necessary for this as there are no checksums or lock files.

### New Features

#### Master Issue Support

Setting `masterIssue` or `masterIssueApproval` values to `true` will result in a "master issue" being created in the repository that lists all outstanding updates, including those which are pending, open, or closed (ignored). By using GitHub's intelligent checkboxes, users are able to request manual rebases or approvals of each listed dependency.

Setting `masterIssue` to `true` makes no change to Renovate functionality and simply adds a type of "mini dashboard issue" to each repo for better visibility of Renovate's branches and PRs.

Setting `masterIssueApproval` to `true` changes Renovate's workflow so that it does not create a branch or PR until after it is "approved" within the Master Issue. Using the Master Issue means you could defer all updates until they are approved, or just defer some of them. e.g. maybe you configure approval for only `major` updates.

#### Manual Rebasing of PRs

Apart from rebasing using the Master Issue, it is also possible to request that Renovate manually rebases a PR from within the PR. You can do this with either of two ways:

1. Rename the PR to being with "rebase!", e.g. Rename it to "rebase! Upgrade dependency nock ........."
2. Add the label "rebase" to the PR

Both of these options will trigger a webhook to Renovate Pro, resulting in it immediately processing the repository and rebasing the PR in question. Having this option might mean you can set `rebaseStalePrs` to `false` in some repos to avoid the "noise" that comes with having the rebased every time automatically.

### Other Improvements

- Better caching has been added to most datasources to improve efficiency and reduce the number of requests, e.g. to github.com or Docker Hub
- Pull Request Body templates are greatly improved and also support easier customization now
- Support for GitHub's new "Check Runs" feature. Note: requires additional privileges for the Renovate Pro app
- Support autodetection for Yarn integrity hashes (Renovate will not add them unless the repository already uses them)
- Specify default Docker registry (Closes #27)
- Support upgrading "short" Docker versions, e.g. from 3.8 to 3.9
- Support an ignore instruction in `requirements.txt`
- Support Python version compatibility restriction

### New GitHub Permissions and Webhooks

Add/grant the following permissions for your Renovate Pro app if available:
- Checks: Read & write
- Security vulnerability alerts: Read-only

Also add webhook event subscriptions for "Issues" so that Renovate Pro can detect when the Master Issue has been edited.
