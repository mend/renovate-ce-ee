# Job APIs

Enabling jobs APIs is done by setting both `MEND_RNV_API_ENABLED: true` and `MEND_RNV_API_ENABLE_JOBS: true` (both are backward compatible with `MEND_RNV_API_ENABLED`)

Job Logs APIs provide a summary of and content for the Job Logs generated by the Renovate CLI.

The Run Job API schedules a Renovate job to run against a given repository.

## Available Job APIs

The list below describes the available Job Logs APIs. Follow the links on the API names for full details.

- [List Jobs by Repo](#list-jobs-by-repo) ← Lists all jobs for a given repo
- [Get Job Logs by Repo](#get-job-logs-by-repo) ← Fetch job logs for a given repo (latest, or by JobID)
- [Get Job Logs by JobID](#get-job-logs-by-jobid) ← Fetch job logs by Job ID
- [Run Job on a Repo](#run-job-on-a-repo) ← Run a Renovate job against a given repo

## Enable Job Logs APIs

Job Logs APIs are enabled with Renovate Admin APIs, which is off by default.

Authentication is done via HTTP Auth, using the API secret as the password.
For example if the secret is `renovateapi` then you would authenticate by adding the following request header:

```
  Authorization: Bearer renovateapi
  or
  Authorization: renovateapi
```
