# Mend Renovate Installation

## Choice of image type

Renovate CE comes with both the default image (e.g. `ghcr.io/mend/renovate-ce:6.0.0`) and a "full" image (e.g. `ghcr.io/mend/renovate-ce:6.0.0`).

The default image is optimized for size and only contains the core Renovate functionality.
It is intended for use with Renovate's `binarySource=install` capability, which dynamically selects and installs third party tools at runtime.

The full image contains preinstalled third-party tools (e.g. Python, Poetry, Node.js, Gradle, etc.) so that you can run Renovate with `binarySource=global` and not require any dynamic runtime installation.

Renovate On-Premises (v5 and earlier) was built with a "full" image only, so if upgrading from an earlier version you may want to use the full image for compatibility.
