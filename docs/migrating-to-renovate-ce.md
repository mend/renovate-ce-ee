# Migrating from Renovate On-Premises to Renovate Community Edition

When migrating from Renovate On-Premises to Renovate Community Edition, you can continue to use the same Bot/User, with just a couple of modifications.

## Health Check

If you are using a "health check" of the Renovate container then you should point it to `/health` in Renovate CE.

## Environment Variable Renaming

Some existing environment variables have been renamed, and some new ones have been added.

See the specific configuration instructions ([GitHub](./configure-renovate-ce-github.md), [GitLab](./configure-renovate-ee-gitlab.md)) to learn more about the variables mentioned below.
